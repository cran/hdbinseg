\title{Bootstrapping for threshold selection in DCBS algorithm}
\usage{
dcbs.thr(
  z,
  interval = c(1, dim(z)[2]),
  phi = 0.5,
  cp.type = 1,
  do.clean.cp = FALSE,
  temporal = TRUE,
  scales = NULL,
  diag = FALSE,
  sgn = NULL,
  B = 1000,
  q = 0.01,
  do.parallel = 4
)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{input data matrix, with each row representing the component time series}

\item{interval}{a vector of two containing the start and the end points of the interval from which the bootstrap test statistics are to be calculated}

\item{phi, cp.type, temporal, scales, diag, B, q, do.parallel}{see \code{\link{dcbs.alg}}}

\item{do.clean.cp}{if \code{do.clean.cp = TRUE} pre-change point cleaning is performed}

\item{sgn}{if \code{diag = FALSE}, wavelet transformations of the cross-covariances are computed with the matching signs}
}
\value{
a numeric value for the threshold
}
\description{
Generate thresholds for DCBS algorithm via bootstrapping
